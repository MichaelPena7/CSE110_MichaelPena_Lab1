### Top 3 Programming Feats
1. Fully made the code of one of my PAs first try the day it was due. _For legal reasons, I must make clear I won't be doing this again_
2. Optimized and played around wih the code of a hurricane simulator. (WIP)
3. Created my own mini Java code project that allows one to create a type chart as seen in Pokemon. Made the standard version, and allowed for the creation of new, unique types.

## Oops... Dropped My To-Do List
- [x] this assignment
- [ ] read more books perhaps
- [ ] make more cs friends!
- [ ] own a frog
- [x] make an epic playlist. [If your interested...](https://spotify.link/JjB4hhSKAIb)

## Cool Quotes

> A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street

> Don't be a fish; be a frog. Swim in the water and jump when you hit ground.

> Cats choose us; we don't own them.
